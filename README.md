## Introduction
Breast cancer is a significant health issue affecting many people worldwide. Early prediction and accurate diagnosis can greatly improve survival rates. This project focuses on building a predictive model to determine the survival of breast cancer patients.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains various features related to breast cancer patients, such as:
- Age
- Tumor size
- Lymph node status
- Hormone receptor status
- Treatment type

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, feature scaling, and encoding categorical variables.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Understanding the distribution and relationships between features.
3. **Model Selection**: Evaluating various machine learning algorithms.
4. **Model Training**: Training the selected model on the dataset.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Assessing the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Results
The final model achieved an accuracy score of **81%**. This indicates the model's effectiveness in predicting breast cancer survival based on the provided features.
